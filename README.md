# Envited Technical Assessment

What I couldn't accomplish in time:
- Hooking up the full form functionality with redux, all the groundwork is there but I just ran out of time due to a silly CSS error I made early and didn't catch for far too long.
- Event page isn't completely finished nor perfectly mirrored
- The form looks aesthetically just awful


What I should have done better: 
- Due to that aforementioned CSS bug, I ended up thinking I had issues with react-router so I ended up spending 45 minutes porting over to NextJS to use next router/searching for the bug before realising it was a silly z-index I set on the body for whatever reason earlier.
- Styling from figma could have been more accurately displayed
- I would have liked proper responsive design, right now its only designed to work on 375x813 resolution with fixed positioning for everything as given my Figma. With a couple more hours, I could have easily implemented proper form functionality and proper responsive design but thats a worry for another time.

# HOSTED ON FIREBASE
Build is based on 375x813 resolution (iphone X on chrome dev tools responsive mode)
Hosting this on firebase didn't take up an exceptionally long time (5 minutes after realising I had hit the wall of what I could achieve at the 3hr45m mark)
